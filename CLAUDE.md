This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an educational content repository containing a comprehensive n8n workflow automation course curriculum. The repository currently consists of a single structured markdown document outlining a 12-16 week course progression from beginner to expert level.

## Repository Structure

- `n8n-beginner-to-expert-course.md` - Main course curriculum document containing 9 modules covering n8n workflow automation topics

## Course Architecture

The course is organized into progressive modules:

1. **Module 1-3 (Weeks 1-5)**: Foundation - Introduction, core concepts, basic workflows, and essential integrations
2. **Module 4-5 (Weeks 6-8)**: Intermediate - Data transformation, logic, error handling, and monitoring
3. **Module 6-7 (Weeks 9-12)**: Advanced - Subworkflows, performance, self-hosting, security, and compliance
4. **Module 8-9 (Weeks 13-16)**: Expert - Real-world applications, AI integrations, custom nodes, and capstone projects

Each module includes:
- Learning objectives
- Topics covered
- Hands-on projects
- Resources and practice ideas

## Content Editing Guidelines

When modifying the course content:

- Maintain the hierarchical structure: Module → Week → Learning Objectives/Topics/Projects
- Keep learning objectives action-oriented and measurable
- Ensure hands-on projects align with the topics covered in each week
- Maintain consistent formatting for sections (use `**bold**` for section headers within modules)
- Each module should build on previous knowledge - avoid introducing concepts before prerequisites
- Balance theory with practical projects (aim for 30% theory, 70% hands-on)

## Key Topics Covered

The course curriculum spans:
- n8n fundamentals and interface navigation
- Node types (triggers, core nodes, function nodes)
- API integrations and authentication
- Data transformation with JavaScript
- Error handling and monitoring
- Production deployment and security
- AI integrations (OpenAI, LangChain)
- Custom node development

## Target Audience Progression

The course assumes learners progress from:
- **Beginner**: No prior n8n knowledge, basic technical skills
- **Intermediate**: Can build complex workflows with logic and error handling
- **Advanced**: Can deploy production systems and implement enterprise features
- **Expert**: Can create custom nodes and architect complex automation systems
